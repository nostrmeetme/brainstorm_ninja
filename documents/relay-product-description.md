## Alternate names

the Grapevine Relay, the Tapestry Relay

## Product Description

nostr relay + DVM + web of trust (+ integrated lightning wallet?)

The Grapevine Relay is an open source personal nostr relay that harnesses web of trust to improve every aspect of your nostr experience. 

First, your Grapevine Relay is a personal archive of any and every piece of nostr content that you deem to be worth keeping. That includes follows, zaps, likes, and any other data used to calculate web of trust scores. 

Second, the relay calculates web of trust scores according to the principles of the Tapestry protocol and uses them:
- It makes those scores readily available to nostr clients so that they can stratify content
- Those scores help you decide which content is worth archiving and which is not
- Those scores can be used to help you decide which npubs should and should not have access to your content

## Monetization

Most users lack the technical skill and / or the motivation to manage their own personal relay. To serve the needs of the majority of nostr users, PGFT will provide a streamlined and easy to use service.

### Free tier

The free tier will keep track of the generic Influence Score plus a handful of contextual Influence Scores. To sign up to the free tier service will require a request in the form of a specialized note.

### Subscription tiers

Subscriptions will allow users to keep track of contextual Influence Scores. A control panel will allow subscribers to choose contexts, to select which data sources to use in the calculation of those scores, and to manage the interpretation of those data sources.

## Customers

Customers will be any nostr user with an npub. (Note this can be regular plebs as well as businesses.)

## Client partnerships

Nostr clients across the ecosystem will have free access to Grapevine Scores to improve their overall user experience. Clients will use these scores to deliver personalized and customizable content stratification and content discovery.

(Hope to pioneer grapevine-client integration through Coracle.)
