          Content Discovery is the app that enables your Grapevine to make recommendations of
          profiles to follow for any given context. These recommendations come in the form of{' '}
          <i>Contextual Recommendation Lists</i>.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          <i>Contextual Recommendation Lists</i> are determined by the{' '}
          <i>Contextual Influence Score</i>. A score of 1 should be interpreted as "average" in
          terms of how much attention your Grapevine recommends you to give to the given profile in
          the given context. Any profile with a score higher than the desired cutoff is placed on
          the list. Calculation of the Score is based on two sources:
          <li>
            Likes and dislikes of wiki articles, with the context set equal to the category of the
            article. For any given context, each like is <i>interpreted</i> as a vote for a score of
            2, and each dislike as a vote for a score of 0.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contextual Endorsements: üëç (Follow / Endorse), üî• (SuperFollow / SuperEndorse), or üëé
            (Block / Mute). For any given context, each üëé is <i>interpreted</i> as a vote for a
            score of 0; each üëç as a vote for a score of 2; and each üî• as a vote for a score of 5.
          </li>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>Likes and dislikes of wiki articles can be issued here or at Wikifreedia.</div>
        <br />
        <div>
          To leave a Contextual Endorsement, click on the Contextual Endorsement tab on a user's
          profile page.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          From these votes, a weighted average is calculated. How much weight any given user has on
          the lists you see below is determined by the <i>generic Influence Score</i> of that user.
          In the future, you will have the option, for any given list, to replace the generic
          Influence Score to a contextual Influence Score of your choosing.
